Top drivers (logistic regression coefficients)
- age: increases risk (coef 0.4817)
- troponin: increases risk (coef 0.2474)
- systolic blood pressure: increases risk (coef 0.2267)
- bad cholesterol LDL: increases risk (coef 0.2054)
- diabetes: increases risk (coef 0.1536)

Regression — lab estimation
- Target: troponin
- Mean absolute error (MAE): 0.04723
- Root mean squared error (RMSE): 0.06961
- Target is log-transformed internally to handle heavy skew; errors are shown in original units.
